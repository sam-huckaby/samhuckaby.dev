# This is the SamHuckaby.dev blog website

I have literally never used Astro before building this, so I'm sure it's full of anti-patterns and goblins, but it was super fun to build it anyways.

The key things I sought to accomplish with this site are:

1. Provide a place to compile my blogified YouTube videos
1. A place to practice i18n, because people should be able to learn in their heart language
1. A chance to explore Astro, since it seems pretty neat
1. Umm... I guess that's it.

**If you're reading this. I believe in you.**
