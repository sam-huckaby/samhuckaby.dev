# Data Structures in Computer Programming

A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, storing, and manipulating data in a computer. It is fundamental in the area of computer science and is the basis for the efficient creation and management of data.

Data structures provide a way to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. They are crucial ingredients in the creation of fast and powerful algorithms. They help manage and organize data, and they make it easier to understand the nature of the data.

## There are two fundamental kinds of data structures:

1. **Primitive Data Structures**: These are the simple data structures that directly operate upon the machine instructions. They have different representations on different computers. Integers, floats, characters, and pointers come under this category.

2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures**: These are more complex data structures, and they are derived from the primitive data structures. They emphasize on grouping same or different data items with relationship between each data item. Arrays, lists, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, heaps, sets, and maps are few examples of non-primitive data structures.

## The Following are examples of data structures used heavily in most programming languages:

1. **Arrays**: An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.

2. **Linked Lists**: A linked list is a linear data structure, where each element is a separate object (node), and each node contains a reference (link) to the next node in the list.

3. **Stacks**: A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.

4. **Queues**: A queue is a common data structure that places elements in a sequence, similar to a stack. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue).

5. **Trees**: A tree is a hierarchical data structure which stores the information naturally in the form of hierarchy style. Tree represents the nodes connected by edges.

6. **Graphs**: A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

7. **Hash Tables**: A Hash Table (also called a Hash, Hash Map or Dictionary) is a data structure that pairs keys to values. Its main operation, which happens very quickly, is to find the value associated with a key.

8. **Heaps**: Heap is a special tree-based data structure, which is a complete tree (all levels are fully filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right). A heap is used in priority queue algorithm and heap sort.

Each of these data structures has its strengths and weaknesses, and they are chosen based on the needs of the specific application or use case. For example, arrays are used for simple lists of values, while trees and graphs are used for more complex hierarchical or connected data. Understanding these data structures and when to use them is a fundamental skill in computer programming.
